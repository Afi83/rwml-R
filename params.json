Richards, and \r\nMark Fetherolf attempts to prepare the reader for the\r\nrealities of machine learning. It covers a basic framework for\r\nmachine-learning projects, then it dives into extended examples that show how\r\nthat basic framework can be applied in realistic situations. It attempts to\r\nprovide the \"hidden wisdom\" on how to go about implementing products and\r\nsolutions based on machine learning. The book is a relatively easy read and\r\ndefinitely worth the investment in time, but all of the supplied code is\r\ncontained in iPython notebooks.  I'm working through the book, reproducing all of the code                                           \r\nlistings and figures using R markdown, and I'm posting\r\nthe results in a github repo: [rwml-R](https://github.com/padamson/rwml-R).                                             \r\n\r\n### Author\r\nThe rwml-R project is maintained by Paul Adamson (@padamson).",
